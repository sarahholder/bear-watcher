# Bear Watcher

## Description
A site that allows the user to enter a bear name and an image to be tracked. Once the information is submitted, the information is added to a bootstrap card below the input form for further tracking of each bear added.  There is also a button for tracking the bears fishing: one for missed attempts, and one for "got it" when they caught the fish.
